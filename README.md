Ask for the hero and dragos's hp and max damage with try and except
The dragon attacks the hero first, then the hero attacks
They take turns until one dies
When the dragon attacks, the program computes a random number between 1 and dragon_max_dmg. This is the damage that the hero sustains. If the hero dies, announce it and the dragon wins.
Same goes for the hero attack
